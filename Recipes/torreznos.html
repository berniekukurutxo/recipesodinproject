<h2>Torreznos Recipe, a delicious and crunchy tapa</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>700 g of marinated/adobo bacon or pork belly</li>
<li>Sunflower oil</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to Make the Torreznos Recipe:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Let the bacon dry at room temperature for 24 hours. Cover it with something in order to avoid residues falling on it.</li>
  <li>After that time, pour sunflower oil into a large frying pan. Enough to cover half of the bacon. Put it on medium low heat.</li>
  <li>While the oil heats up, cut the bacon into 2.5 cm (1 inch) strips.</li>
  <li>Place the strips in the frying pan with the crust facing down (being the surface in contact with the oil). Make sure they do not turn around. You can use two forks on each side to push them and prevent them from moving.</li>
  <li>Fry the torreznos for 30-40 minutes over medium heat. The oil should cover half of the torreznos.</li>
  <li>After a few minutes, bubbles will appear on the crust. Leave it in the position we have talked about until bubbles start to appear all over the surface.</li>
  <li>Turn to cook the sides and let bubbles form on them. Remember to fry the torreznos with a medium-low heat; it should not be high, since it would affect the crunchy result.</li>
  <li>Once the torreznos are covered with bubbles and the crust is golden, remove them from the frying pan and place them on kitchen paper to drain the oil.</li>
  <li>Let them cool down a little and enjoy! You can eat them warm or cold!
